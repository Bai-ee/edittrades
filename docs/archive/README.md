## Current Documentation

For up-to-date strategy documentation, see:

- **`docs/STRATEGY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete strategy reference
- **`docs/STRATEGY_MODES.md`** - STANDARD vs AGGRESSIVE mode details
- **`docs/ADDING_STRATEGIES.md`** - Best practices for adding new strategies
- **`docs/STRATEGY_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`** - System architecture and audit

## Why Archived?

These files were archived because:
1. Information consolidated into comprehensive guides
2. Some data paths may be outdated
3. Confidence system now uses hierarchical weighting (not fully documented in old files)
4. Redundant with newer documentation

## Note

These files are preserved for historical reference. For current implementation details, always refer to the main `docs/` folder documentation.
